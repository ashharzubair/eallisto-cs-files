00:00:01.857 --> 00:00:03.729
<v Jonas>Now before we start coding,</v>

2
00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:05.932
we need two essential tools.

3
00:00:05.932 --> 00:00:08.863
First, a code editor to write our code,

4
00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:12.899
and second, a browser to run and test the code.

5
00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.630
So let's now very quickly set up these tools

6
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.463
before we get to work.

7
00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:21.090
So let's start with a text editor.

8
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.417
Now, some people like to teach JavaScript

9
00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:26.474
right in a browser console, or some other tool,

10
00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:29.648
but I like to use a real world text editor.

11
00:00:29.648 --> 00:00:33.350
And the editor that I personally use is Brackets.

12
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.488
And so I'm going to use it for this course as well.

13
00:00:36.488 --> 00:00:38.645
Now, if you have your own favorite text editor,

14
00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:42.759
then you can and should of course, use that one.

15
00:00:42.759 --> 00:00:45.371
And I know that some people prefer Atom

16
00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:47.788
or Sublime or something else.

17
00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:51.356
So, you can really use whatever you like the most

18
00:00:51.356 --> 00:00:55.958
because every text editor works without any restrictions.

19
00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.483
But if you don't have a favorite text editor yet,

20
00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:00.846
then you can use Brackets like me.

21
00:01:00.846 --> 00:01:04.678
And here is where you download it, so it's just Brackets.io.

22
00:01:04.678 --> 00:01:06.555
It's really an amazing free editor

23
00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:08.349
that has a lot of features,

24
00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:10.061
and lots of extensions and themes

25
00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:14.250
that you can just download, and also all for free.

26
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.894
So, if you downloaded Brackets, this is how it's going

27
00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:19.623
to look like when you first open the app.

28
00:01:19.623 --> 00:01:21.782
Maybe just with some different colors

29
00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:24.294
but that's because they have a different theme.

30
00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:27.312
And you can easily install themes just over here

31
00:01:27.312 --> 00:01:29.729
okay, here on the right side.

32
00:01:31.254 --> 00:01:33.335
So here on themes,

33
00:01:33.335 --> 00:01:37.082
and we can also install extensions right here.

34
00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:38.921
And actually there's one extension

35
00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:41.085
that you should install right away,

36
00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:43.325
and that's called Autosave.

37
00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.341
So it's this one, Autosave Files on Window Blur.

38
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:48.827
And what this extension does is to automatically

39
00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:52.411
save all your files as soon as you leave the app.

40
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:54.012
So that's extremely useful

41
00:01:54.012 --> 00:01:56.337
when you want to reload your webpage or app

42
00:01:56.337 --> 00:01:58.191
in the browser.

43
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:00.558
Which brings us to the browser.

44
00:02:00.558 --> 00:02:02.353
So let's close this, and here in Brackets

45
00:02:02.353 --> 00:02:06.441
we can hit this icon, and then it opens the browser

46
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:09.747
with the webpage that we're currently working on.

47
00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:13.328
So, we're going to write our code here in the text editor,

48
00:02:13.328 --> 00:02:16.432
and then run it in the browser in here.

49
00:02:16.432 --> 00:02:17.979
And in my case, the browser

50
00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.723
that I'm using is the latest version of Google Chrome,

51
00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:25.311
but once again, you can use another browser if you prefer,

52
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.597
like Safari or Firefox

53
00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:30.698
as long as it has a JavaScript console,

54
00:02:30.698 --> 00:02:34.330
and a JavaScript console is an extremely useful tool

55
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.762
to code in JavaScript because it shows us errors,

56
00:02:37.762 --> 00:02:40.325
allows us to log data, and also to interact

57
00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:43.466
with the JavaScript code or for apps.

58
00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:45.946
And so we're going to be using it all the time.

59
00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:47.706
And so you need a modern browser

60
00:02:47.706 --> 00:02:50.150
that has a JavaScript console.

61
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.926
So let me just quickly show you the console here

62
00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:56.017
by hitting the View menu, Developer,

63
00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:58.350
and then JavaScript Console.

64
00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:01.277
Okay, and down here it is.

65
00:03:01.277 --> 00:03:03.762
And you see there's already an error here, right?

66
00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:05.840
But it doesn't really matter now.

67
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.954
So in Google Chrome, the console is part

68
00:03:07.954 --> 00:03:11.495
of these Google Chrome dev tools here, okay?

69
00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:13.986
So all these is the Google dev tools,

70
00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:17.086
but we're just interested in the console for now.

71
00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:19.489
And just to show you how it works, the instruction

72
00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.285
that we're going to use the most is console log,

73
00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:24.535
just like this.

74
00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:29.693
So let's log something to the console.

75
00:03:29.693 --> 00:03:31.693
You know, "Hello World."

76
00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:35.703
Hit return, and here it is.

77
00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:38.025
So we're going to be using this console log,

78
00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:40.670
a method here, all the time in our code

79
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.646
to log stuff to the console.

80
00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:46.281
All right, and this is actually all we need

81
00:03:46.281 --> 00:03:49.185
to start writing JavaScript code and running it.

82
00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:52.159
So no complicated set ups or configurations

83
00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.601
like in other programming languages.

84
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.413
And this simplicity in getting started is really one

85
00:03:57.413 --> 00:04:01.202
of the big advantages of learning JavaScript.

86
00:04:01.202 --> 00:04:04.746
All right, and so we're now ready to move on.

87
00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:08.329
And once again, good luck with this course.
